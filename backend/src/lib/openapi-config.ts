**üîê Authentication & CSRF Protection**

This API requires both JWT authentication and CSRF tokens for protected operations. 

**Quick Start for Testing:**

1. **Login**: Use POST /api/auth/login with credentials: \`admin@raco.com\` / \`admin123\`
2. **Get CSRF Token**: Copy the \`csrfToken\` from the login response
3. **Authorize**: Click the "Authorize" button below and enter:
   - **csrfToken**: Paste the CSRF token here
   - **bypassCsrf**: For development, enter \`development\` to skip CSRF

**Alternative Testing Methods:**
- Use GET /api/auth/csrf-token to get a CSRF token without logging in
- Set header \`X-Bypass-CSRF: development\` to bypass CSRF in development mode

All POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations require either a valid CSRF token or the bypass header.`,
